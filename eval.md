# Challange

* Using the tools and language of your choice, write code that deploys the application provided in `app/` using a single command.
* The single command from the user can (and likely will) call a longer shell script, or other configuration management code.
* The script should make the backend service available via https over the public internet.
* The script should output the address of the `backend` api.
* The script should cause the checkin event handler to be triggered regularly by an automated process.
* Your credentials are attached. You have admin access to the account. Please use region `us-east-1`.
* We ask that you not use ec2 directly for your solution. However, something like a fargate cluster in which ec2 instances are managed by aws is okay.
* You should not need to make changes to the existing application code. 

# NFR

  * Budget - 3 hours
  * Timely commits
  * Document approach, assumptions, and reasoning

# Criteria

  * Quality of your code and configuration
  * Clarity of your written communication and documentation
  * Communicating how your code works in our review session.
  * Communicating how the app runs in our review session.
  * Project presentation.

# Approach

According to the experiment, work is not to exceed 3 total hours, therefore I have sub-divided the total work across a total week of 30 minutes per day, providing a total of 6 days to complete the work on budget, upon which, the project will be submitted.

# Assumptions

# Reasoning

# Timeline

#### Day 1

Reading readme.md, reading over the Dockerfiles, validating access, etc.

#### Day 2

Re-reading readme.md, installing some tooling such as CDK, validating non-UI access with API keys, etc, testing provisioned sandbox account with some basic commands.

#### Day 3

#### Day 4

#### Day 5

#### Day 6
